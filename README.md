<h2>What is Malware</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Malware is the generic term applied to software that is utilized for malicious purposes. </li><br>
	<li>That is not to say that malware cannot be employed for other means but typically in the context of cybersecurity, any software utilized to subvert the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of information and the systems that process them are referred to as malware. 
</li><br>
	<li>The term Malware is a combination of two words Malicious and Software. It is a common term that is used to denote a software or script that is implicitly designed to create damage to any computer, smartphone, IoT devices, Network, and other programmable devices. </li><br>
	<li>The damage can be anything like hijacking the browser, locking the essential files, degrading the device's performance, and many such. </li>
</ul>

<h2>Types of Malware</h2>
<ul>
	<li>The term Malware was coined by Yisrael Rada in 1990, though Malware was already in existence in the form of viruses. </li><br>
	<li>Usually, computer users confuse Malware with a virus. However, that is only partially true. The virus is, in fact, one of the types of Malware. It means all viruses are Malware, but not every Malware is a virus. </li><br>
	<li>After infiltrating your system, a Malware program can create havoc, and damages can be beyond monetary. Different Malware types perform a distinct level of damage. For example, a browser hijacker would take control of your web browser and manipulate its settings to install a rogue extension or to promote an affiliated page. </li><br>
 <li>Similarly, Ransomware would encrypt all your system files and documents that can only be decrypted by a decrypting tool or key gained after paying the ransom. </li>
 </ul>

<h3>Based on the infiltrating nature, attack type, and damage levels, malware are broadly classified into 10 types:</h3> 

 <ul>
	 <li><h3><ins>Viruses</ins></h3>
	 <ul>
		 <li>The virus is the oldest Malware type and one of the most common. It is a computer program that, after infiltrating the system, replicates itself by modifying the codes of other programs. It also has the ability to reproduce in large numbers. A virus needs a host program to write its code on that program and replicate. Viruses are usually spread through a word file or executable file.</li>
	 </ul>
	 
  </li>
	  <li><h3><ins>Worms</ins></h3></li>
   <ul>
		 <li>A worm is a malicious program that uses computer networks to spread itself. It takes advantage of the security failures of a system to target it. Once it takes control of a device, it will scan other systems connected to it and infect them. Unlike viruses, worms do not need a host to grow. The worms are largely spread through emails and message services.</li>
	 </ul>
	  <li><h3><ins>Trojans</ins></h3></li>
   <ul>
		 <li>A Trojan is a malicious program that pretends to be legitimate and attracts users to install it by misrepresenting itself as useful software for their system. It is one of the most dangerous malware since it can remain unnoticed by the user and work silently in the background. Once it gets entered into the system, the attackers behind it can gain unauthorized access to your device and steal your private information and data. The Trojan can also install other dangerous malware like Ransomware. Trojans are mainly spread through utility software, spam email attachments.</li>
	 </ul>
	  <li><h3><ins>Spyware</ins></h3></li>
   <ul>
		 <li>Spyware is an ill-disposed, unwanted computer program that stealthily spies activities on your system and reports everything to its creator. Some Spyware can install malicious programs and change system settings. It is one of the most common malware infections since it easily enters the system when users click on an intriguing pop-up or through a bundled software.</li>
	 </ul>
	  <li><h3><ins>Ransomware</ins></h3></li>
   <ul>
		 <li>Ransomware is one of the most dangerous malware programs. It is mainly because, unlike other common malicious programs, there is probably no cure for Ransomware attacks. After infiltrating your system, Ransomware locks your files and folders with a robust encryption algorithm. The attacker behind it then asks you for ransom in return for a decrypting tool or key. Mostly Ransomware is spread through drive-by downloads or phishing.</li>
	 </ul>
	  <li><h3><ins>Adware</ins></h3></li>
   <ul>
		 <li>Adware is unwanted software designed to bombard irrelevant, untrustworthy ads on your web browser or sometimes randomly on your screen. It usually enters through malicious web extensions or rogue software.</li>
	 </ul>
	  <li><h3><ins>Rootkit</ins></h3></li>
   <ul>
		 <li>A Rootkit is a type of malware that provides the root privilege to the attacker. A root privilege means getting the administrative rights of the system. It acts as a backdoor for other malware to enter the system. Since Rootkits reside deep inside the kernel of the operating system, it is challenging to detect and remove them. Many times, reinstalling the OS is the only option.</li>
	 </ul>
	 <li><h3><ins>Keylogger</ins></h3></li>
  <ul>
		 <li>A keylogger is a dangerous malware that records all your keystrokes. It sends it to the attacker, who can analyze the keys you press and dig out the sensitive information such as login credentials, banking details, and literally anything private that you enter using your keyboard.</li>
	 </ul>
	 <li><h3><ins>Browser Hijacker</ins></h3></li>
  <ul>
		 <li>Browser hijacker, also known as browser virus, is a malware type that can take control of your browser and change its settings to promote an affiliated page or a fake search engine. By hijacking the browser's settings, the browser hijacker can also initiate the drive-by downloads and change settings like default search engine, homepage, new tab redirect, and more. A Browser Hijacker can also introduce other malware like Trojans, Adware, or Keyloggers to the system. Browser Hijacker usually gets entry through a rogue web extension or add-ons.</li>
	 </ul>
	 <li><h3><ins>Botnet</ins></h3></li>
  <ul>
		 <li>A Botnet is a network of infected computers controlled remotely by a cybercriminal. Each bot acts as a Zombie and infects other systems to join it in the Botnet. Hackers can use a Botnet for carrying out various malicious activities like DDoS attacks, cryptojacking, keylogging, and more.</li>
	 </ul>
 </ul>


<h2>Protection from malware</h2>
<ul>
<li>There are actually two areas to consider where protection is concerned: protective tools and user vigilance. </li><br>
<li>The first is often the easiest to implement, simply because you can often set and forget best-in-class protective software that manages and updates itself. Users, on the other hand, can be prone to temptation ("check out this cool website!") or easily led by other emotions such as fear ("install this antivirus software immediately").</li><br>
<li>Education is key to ensure users are aware of the risk of malware and what they can do to prevent an attack. </li>
</ul>

<h3>It is better to prevent Malware from entering the system rather than handling them afterward. Here are tips for that:</h3>
<ul>
<li><ins>Use a Robust Antimalware Solution</ins></li>
<ul>
	<li>It is better to keep installed a robust antimalware solution on your system to prevent Malware programs from infiltrating your system. Windows users can rely on the in-built Microsoft Defender security suite. However, an added security program would ensure total security.</li>
	<br>
</ul>
<li><ins>Keep your software and OS up to date</ins></li>
	<ul>
	<li>Regularly updating software would fix its vulnerabilities and security loopholes. Similarly, updating the operating system would ensure that the latest security patches are installed on the device and cybercriminals couldn't exploit the vulnerabilities.</li>
		<br>
</ul>
<li><ins>Backup your computer</ins></li>
	<ul>
	<li>Regular backing up the system would nullify the effect of malware attacks like Ransomware. It would also help you in accidental data loss such as hard disk failure, device stolen, etc.</li><br>
</ul>
<li><ins>Careful while opening email</ins></li>
	<ul>
	<li>As already said, emails are a popular way to spread Malware, so it is advised not to open emails from an unknown sender. Even if you opened the mail, don't download the attachments and click on the links.</li><br>
</ul>
<li><ins>Follow healthy browsing practices</ins></li>
<ul>
	<li>Avoid clicking on the attractive pop-ups and banner ads.</li>
	<li>Avoid downloading from unsecured sources.</li>
	<li>Never download anything from torrent sites. </li>
</ul>



 
</ul>





 


<h2>Conclusion</h2>

Malicious software is often used to capture information from users, erase or steal data, and even use a computer as a part of a larger botnet army. Students should learn what happens when this type of software is installed, how it is installed with or without the user's knowledge, and what can be done to prevent it. There is a myriad of software that is written to subvert traditional operations of systems. Not all are utilized with an intent to harm however, when they do so, they are referred to as malware. The various types mentioned above are typically employed in concert in order to enact effects against a system. Robust software development practices, employee training, regular backups and patching and defense in depth can help mitigate the effects of malware.
